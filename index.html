                    make over 100
                    different sounds, while dogs can only make about 10? Cats also have a specialized collarbone,
                    allowing them to always land on their feet when they fall. Their purring, often associated with
                    happiness, is also a way they self-heal—cats purr at a frequency that promotes bone and tissue
                    regeneration! Plus, the pattern on every cat’s nose is as unique as a human fingerprint. These
                    mysterious, independent pets certainly have some extraordinary qualities.
